# About install.sh

This file does the heavy lifting to do first-time configuration & app installation.

This README file explains a bit of the history/details of what's being installed w/ relevant links & such.

## Fonts

I love installing fonts with homebrew!

```shell
echo "Configure homebrew"
brew tap homebrew/cask
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts

echo "Installing fonts"
# https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode
brew install font-fira-code

brew install font-jetbrains-mono

```

## Programing language version control
